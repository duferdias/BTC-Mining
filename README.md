# BTC-Mining
Stratum-Proxy installer and scripts that install, compile and configure the CPUminer-OPT-v3.8.0 In Linux environment for Bitcoin mining in the Zpool.ca.

To mine in the Zpool with Stratum-Proxy the git user must first create a personal file and copy all the code from File "inst" for your new file and only after this edit the penultimate line replacing the existing domain there by your IP or by its domain.

Mining scripts can be executed automatically with the system startup.
